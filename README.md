# Digital-System-Design
Our idea is basic and simple but it could drastically change the way our technology handles dealing with the everyday life of the people with special needs. Our basic concepts includes a moving vehicle which uses certain kind of sensor that reads the color of a specific line and moves about that line, furthermore it uses a sensor which detects the presence of an obstacle to prevent it from colliding with it.
The sensors used is LDR for reading the color of the line and ultrasonic to detect the obstacle

#Resources used : 
Most of our resources were only datasheets and how to operate the sensors these data sheets helped decide the input voltages ,how to rotate the motor, the distance for recognizing obstacles ,and how to operate the line detecting sensor module

#4) Results and Limitations: 
The most important result that we worked as a whole team on a project which was really on a tight schedule due to clashing with most quiz 3 which are pretty much essential to most students. However, we were able to cope with these circumstances we had to develop a time management schedule which would aid us all in not only managing this project but also other projects and quizzes. The results were satisfying as we were able to program the car to stop on detection of an obstacle, propagate when the line is visible, turn left and right, and stop when there is no line. As nothing worth having comes easy we faced a bit of problems. Due to them being many a list was made to be able to track these problems in order to avoid it in further project developments.
Most if not all electronics shops close at 7:00 P.M where most students have fifth which ends at 5:30.
Sharing the Altera was a bit not easy especially with the tight schedule we as students have.
We were not able to find shops near our vicinity and we had to waste huge amounts of time on transportation to visit electronics shops.
Most shops are facing problems with the customs in Egypt so most products were blocked from entering Egypt due to some problems with the customs.
Not being able to find long wires to help to move the car easily on the board.
Buying a car which was the last one in a shop far away from our homes, as the near one didnâ€™t have the car, which was defected and we had to try to fix it as its dimensions were not made with perfection this lead to a wheel moving faster than another as one wheel was not straight.
